1. Given are two one-dimensional arrays A and B which are sorted in ascending order. Write a program to merge them into a single sorted array C that contains every item from arrays A and B, in ascending order. [List]

2. Get this output using simple loops. Here no of iterations are important. 
ABBCCCDDDDEEEEE 
AABBBCCCCDDDDD 
AAABBBBCCCCC 
AAAABBBBB 
AAAAA

3. Write a program using List in Python (don't use built in functions)
   1. Add Element at the beginning
   2. Add Element at specific position
   3. Search an element into list and print its position
   4. Count how many even, odd and prime numbers in the list
   5. Find the duplicate elements in the list
   6. Add element at the end in the list
   7. Sort Elements in Ascending and Descending Order
   8. Check two list, if they are equal or not

4. Write a program to check whether two matrices are equal or not.

5. Write a Python program to count frequency of digits in a given number.
	Example: 123123112296
	Output
	Frequency of 0 = 0
	Frequency of 1 = 4
	Frequency of 2 = 4
	Frequency of 3 = 2
	Frequency of 4 = 0
	Frequency of 5 = 0
	Frequency of 6 = 1
	Frequency of 7 = 0
	Frequency of 8 = 0
	Frequency of 9 = 1
